"""
Mini-Project: The Vault of Ascii
You are a master codebreaker trying to bypass a three-layered security system on the "Vault of Ascii." To get in, you must correctly guess three secret numbers in a row. Each number is between 1 and 25. Are you up to the challenge?

Project Goal
Your mission is to write a Python script that functions as a multi-stage number guessing game. The program must successfully guide a player through three consecutive rounds of guessing a secret number. If the player fails at any stage, the vault's defenses activate, and the game is over.

Rules & Requirements
Three Stages: The game must consist of three sequential stages. The player must clear all three to win.
Secret Numbers: Before each stage, the program must generate a new random integer between 1 and 25 (inclusive). You'll need to use the random module for this.
Limited Guesses: The player only gets five attempts to guess the secret number at each stage.
Hints: After every incorrect guess, the program must provide a hint, telling the player whether their guess was "Too high!" or "Too low!".
Input Validation: The program must check if the player's guess is within the valid range of 1 to 25. If the player enters a number outside this range (e.g., 0 or 26), it should print an error message like "Invalid range. Guess must be between 1 and 25." This guess should not count as one of their five attempts.
Stage Progression:
If the player guesses the number correctly within five attempts, a success message like "Stage 1 Cleared! Moving to the next level..." should be displayed. The game then immediately proceeds to the next stage with a new secret number.
If the player fails to guess the number in five attempts, the game ends immediately. A failure message must be shown, revealing the secret number (e.g., "System lockdown! The correct number was 17. Better luck next time.").
Winning the Game: If the player successfully clears all three stages, a final victory message should be displayed, for example: "Access Granted! You have successfully bypassed all three security layers of the Vault of Ascii."
Required Concepts Checklist
Your final code must make meaningful use of the following concepts and only these concepts (plus basic operators and the print() and input() functions):

[ ] import statement (specifically import random)
[ ] for loops and the range() function
[ ] while loops
[ ] if, elif, and else statements
[ ] break statements
[ ] continue statements
Challenge Tip: Think about how you can use nested loops. An outer loop could manage the three stages of the game, while an inner loop handles the five guesses for each stage. Where would break and continue be most effective in controlling these loops? Good luck! üßê
