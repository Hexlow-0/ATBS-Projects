"""
Enter a number: 8
That number is even.
And it's divisible by 4 â€” neat!

Do you want to enter another number? (y/n): y

Enter a number: 97
That number is odd.
Also... bit of a weird number. What are you, a philosopher?

Do you want to enter another number? (y/n): n
Thanks for playing!
