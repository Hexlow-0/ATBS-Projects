"""
ðŸ§© Requirements:
The secret number is hardcoded, e.g. 13.
The user gets up to 5 guesses.

After each wrong guess:
If the guess is too high, tell them "Too high!"
If the guess is too low, tell them "Too low!"
If they guess correctly, congratulate them and end the game early.
If they fail all 5 times, tell them the number and end the game.
