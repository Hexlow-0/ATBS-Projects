"""
‚úÖ Requirements:
import random at the top (this is allowed in Chapter 3).
Create a function roll_die() that returns a random number between 1 and 6.

Create another function roll_dice() that:
Calls roll_die() twice
Returns both dice and their sum

Create a function check_win(total) that returns True if the total is 7 or 11, else False.

Create a function play_game() that:

Runs the roll
Prints the two dice and total
Prints win/loss message based on check_win()
Use a loop so the user can keep playing or quit by typing 'q'.
