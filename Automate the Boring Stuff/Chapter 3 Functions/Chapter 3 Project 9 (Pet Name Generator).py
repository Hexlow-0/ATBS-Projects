"""
Requirements:

Ask the user:
Their favorite color
A word theyâ€™d use to describe themselves
Their favorite animal

Create a function called generate_pet_name() that takes these three inputs as arguments and returns a custom pet name string like:
"Your pet name is: BlueFierceTiger!"

Create another function called run_pet_namer() that:
Handles the inputs
Calls generate_pet_name() with the answers

Prints the result

Add a loop so the user can generate multiple pet names until they type 'q' to quit.
