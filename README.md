# Python for Automation and Analysis

## Objective

This repository serves as a portfolio of my work from Al Sweigart's "Automate the Boring Stuff with Python (2nd Edition)." Its purpose is to demonstrate the systematic development of core programming and automation skills, with a direct focus on their application to challenges in cybersecurity, data analysis, and intelligence.

## üìÅ Project Structure

The repository is organized by book chapter. Each directory contains scripts that solve specific problems, demonstrating proficiency in distinct programming concepts.

### Chapter 02 ‚Äì Flow Control
* **`guess_the_number.py`**: A script that demonstrates conditional logic and loop control for iterative problem-solving.
* **`id_checker.py`**: Implements branching logic and input validation, a fundamental practice in secure software development.
* *Further projects will be added to demonstrate mastery of foundational control structures.*

### Chapter 03 ‚Äì Functions
* **`magic_8_ball.py`**: A simple application demonstrating the use of a function and randomisation, foundational for creating probabilistic models or simulations.
* **`coin_flip_simulation.py`**: A basic script to model probabilistic outcomes, showcasing the use of functions to structure and repeat simple operations.
* *Additional projects will focus on building modular, reusable, and well-documented code.*

*(Additional chapters and projects will be populated as I progress through the Textbook.)*

## üõ†Ô∏è Setup and Usage

All scripts are written in Python 3 and rely only on the standard library, ensuring portability and minimal dependencies.

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/Hexlow-0/automate-the-boring-stuff-projects.git](https://github.com/Hexlow-0/automate-the-boring-stuff-projects.git)
    ```
2.  **Navigate to a project directory:**
    ```bash
    cd Chapter-02-Flow-Control
    ```
3.  **Execute a script:**
    ```bash
    python3 guess_the_number.py
    ```

## üß† Core Competencies Developed

This coursework is actively developing my proficiency in the following areas:

* **Logical Problem Solving**: Deconstructing complex problems into smaller, manageable components implemented with clean, logical code.
* **Code Quality and Maintainability**: Adhering to PEP 8 standards to produce readable, well-documented, and maintainable code.
* **Fundamental Automation**: Scripting interactions with the operating system, handling user input, and managing control flow to automate repetitive tasks.
* **Data Structures and Algorithms**: Applying fundamental data structures (lists, dictionaries) and algorithmic thinking to process and manipulate data.
* **Debugging and Testing**: Learning to effectively identify and resolve errors in code to ensure script reliability and correctness.

## üåâ Bridging Theory and Application for Cybersecurity

While these projects are foundational, they build skills directly applicable to cybersecurity domains. As the projects advance, they will increasingly demonstrate capabilities relevant to:

* **Pattern Matching (Regex)**: Essential for log analysis, threat intelligence correlation, and data exfiltration detection.
* **File I/O and Data Handling**: Foundational for forensic analysis, malware analysis, and manipulating structured data (e.g., CSV, JSON).
* **Web Scraping**: A key technique for Open-Source Intelligence (OSINT) gathering and monitoring web-based threats.
* **Process Automation**: The core skill required for building security orchestration, automation, and response (SOAR) tooling.

## üöÄ Future Project Goals

Upon completion of the book, my objective is to extend these concepts by developing original projects, including:

1.  **Log File Analyser**: A script to parse web server or system logs using regular expressions to identify anomalous activity (e.g., failed logins, specific error codes).
2.  **OSINT Aggregator**: A tool to scrape and collate data from public sources based on specific keywords or targets.
3.  **Automated File Sorter**: A script to organise files based on their type, date, or other metadata, with applications in data management and forensics preparation.
4.  **Configuration File Validator**: A tool to ensure system configuration files adhere to a defined security baseline.
